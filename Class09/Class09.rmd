```

Today we will be doing an unsupervising learning analysis of Human Breast Cancer Cells.

We have been given this information from the *Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Data Set*
```{r}
#Lets read in and save our new data directory
wisc.df<- read.csv("WisconsinCancer.csv")
#head(wisc.df)

#if you want to see how many patients are in the data set, check num of rows
#nrow(wisc.df)
```

We now want to convert our read in file to a matrix. 
```{r}
#Convert columns 3-32
#Lets now convert the columns of data into a matrix
wisc.data <- as.matrix(wisc.df[,3:32])

```

To keep track of different observations throughout modeling, assign row names of *wisc.data* to the values contained in *id* column of *wisc.df*
```{r}
#Assign row names
row.names(wisc.data) <- wisc.df$id
#head(wisc.data)
```

We now want to create a new vector **Diagnosis** that will be 1 if a diagnosis is malignant and 0 otherwise.
```{r}
diagnosis <- as.numeric(wisc.df$diagnosis == "M")
```

Let's explore the data a little bit.
Q1: How many observations are in this dataset
```{r}
nrow(wisc.df)
```
Q2: How many variables/features in the data are suffixed with _mean:
```{r}
#Looking for columns ending w _mean
inds <- grep("_mean", colnames(wisc.data))
length(inds)
```
Q3: How many observations have malignant diagnosis?
```{r}
table(wisc.df$diagnosis)

#or use

sum(diagnosis)
```

#Section 2: Principal Component Analysis

Lets first check if the data needs to be scaled.
```{r}
colMeans(wisc.data)

apply(wisc.data,2,sd)
```

```{r}
wisc.pr <- prcomp(wisc.data, scale = TRUE)

summary(wisc.pr)
```

**Q4: From results, what proportion of the original variance is captured by the first principal components (PC1)?**
From looking at the summary section *Proportion of Variance* we see PC1 covers 44.27%

**Q5. How many principal components (PCs) are required to describe at least 70% of the original variance in the data?**
By PC3 we see more than 70% of original variance

**Q6. How many principal components (PCs) are required to describe at least 90% of the original variance in the data?**
By PC7 we have covered 90%

Now we want to interpret our PCA results:
```{r}
biplot(wisc.pr)
```
We see that rownames in the biplot make any trends very difficult to see. So it might be better to generate a standard scatter plot
```{r}
palette(c("royalblue", "deeppink", "red"))
plot(wisc.pr$x[,1],wisc.pr$x[,2], col = diagnosis+1, xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2")

```

Lets see a plot of PC1 and PC3!
```{r}
palette(c("plum2", "powderblue"))
plot(wisc.pr$x[,1], wisc.pr$x[,3], xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC3", col = diagnosis + 1 )
```

Lets discuss Variance a bit more: 
A good way to pick a natrual number of principal components is by looking at a scree plot and look for the "elbow".
```{r}
#Lets calculate variance of each principal component
pr.var <- wisc.pr$sdev^2
head(pr.var)
```

We now want to divide by the total variance of all principal components:
```{r}
pve <- round((pr.var/sum(pr.var))*100,1)

plot(pve, xlab = "Principal Component", ylab = "Proportion of Variance Explained", ylim = c(0,100), type = "o")
```

We can also barplot this data:
```{r}
barplot(pve,ylab = "Precent of Variance Explained", names.arg = paste0("PC", 1:length(pve)), las = 2, axes = FALSE, col = rainbow(ncol(wisc.pr$x)))

axis(2,at = pve, labels = round(pve,2)*100)

```

Plot the cumulative proportion of variance:
```{r}
plot(cumsum(pve), xlab = "Principal Component", 
     ylab = "Cumulative Proportion of Variance Explained", 
     ylim = c(0, 100), type = "o")
```

#Hierarchical Clustering of Case Data
```{r}
data.scaled <- scale(wisc.data)

data.dist <- dist(data.scaled)

wisc.hclust <- hclust(data.dist, method = "complete")
```

Now lets plot our clustering
```{r}
plot(wisc.hclust)

abline(a = 19 , b = 0, col = "cornflowerblue", lty = 2)

```

Lets compare outputs from clustering to actual diagnoses. We will use **cutree()** to do so:
```{r}
wisc.hclust.clusters <- cutree(wisc.hclust, k = 3)
```

Use **table()** function to compare cluster membership:
```{r}
table(wisc.hclust.clusters, diagnosis)
```

##Cluster in PCA Results:

For clustering we need:
1. Distance Matrix
2. Clustering Function
3. Cut Tree
```{r}
dist.pca <- dist(wisc.pr$x[,1:2])

pc.hclust <- hclust(dist.pca, method = "ward.D2")
plot(pc.hclust)
```

```{r}
cut.pc <- cutree(pc.hclust, k = 3)
table(cut.pc, diagnosis)
```

```{r}
palette(c("steelblue1", "mediumpurple1", "lightsalmon1"))
plot(wisc.pr$x[,1:2], col = cut.pc)
```


##Prediction
We are going to use function **predict()** that will take our PCA model from  before and new cancer cell data and project the data onto our PCA space.
```{r}
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/new-samples-CSV"
new <- read.csv(url)
npc <- predict(wisc.pr, newdata = new)
```

```{r}
palette(c("darkorchid", "hotpink2"))
plot(wisc.pr$x[,1:2], col = diagnosis+1)
points(npc[,1], npc[,2], col = "lightgoldenrod", pch = 16, cex = 2)
```

From the data seen above, doctors should prioritize following up with the patient falling in the purple region.
